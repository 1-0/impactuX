The game is based on the mechanics of the game kollision from KDE and linux classic game killbill.

As a player gets a working electronic device ("Device"), on which can get viruses ("bad" operating system), resulting in a collision to collapse (fall) device, but repel each other.
Viruses may interfere with the defenders ("good" programs) that are moving faster than viruses themselves do not interact with them, upon receipt of which is facilitated by the game to the user.
